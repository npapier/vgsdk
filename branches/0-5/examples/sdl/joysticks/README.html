<h2>SDL Joystick Demo</h2>

<p>This program demonstrates the use of <strong>SDL-based joysticks</strong>.
It runs in a console and outputs a line of text for each event received from a joytsick.
To terminate the application, you will have to find the right <em>combo</em> or you will need to kill it <kbd>:)</kbd></p>
