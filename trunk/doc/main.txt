 * @section about About vgSDK
 * 
 * Welcome to the (V)ersatile (G)raphical (S)oftware (D)evelopment (K)it. \c vgSDK provides a C++ programming interface to do 
 * graphical jobs. Its main goal is to create real-time graphics applications and to obtain easily high-performance and reliable
 * graphics applications.\n
 * Typical applications are in the fields of virtual reality, augmented reality, research papers, games and graphical computation.
 *
 * \c vgSDK hides low-level details on graphics programming and reduces drastically the work required to start with a 
 * graphical application. It provides a set of geometrical and mathematical classes that are needed in almost every graphics program.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * @section Prerequisites
 * 
 * \c vgSDK is intended for users who are already familiar with C++ and have basic graphics programming skills (like 3d 
 * transformation and coordinate system, mesh, texture...). Knowledges about OpenGL or Direct3D could help, but are not
 * absolutely needed.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * @section project_page Project Page
