 * @section about About vgSDK
 * 
 * Welcome to the (V)ersatile (G)raphical (S)oftware (D)evelopment (K)it. \c vgSDK provides a C++ programming interface to do 
 * graphical jobs. Its main goal is to create real-time graphics applications and to obtain easily high-performance and reliable
 * graphics applications.\n
 * Typical applications are in the fields of virtual reality, augmented reality, research papers, games and graphical computation.
 *
 * \c vgSDK hides low-level details on graphics programming and reduces drastically the work required to start with a 
 * graphical application. It provides a set of geometrical and mathematical classes that are needed in almost every graphics program.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * @section Prerequisites
 * 
 * \c vgSDK is intended for users who are already familiar with C++ and have basic graphics programming skills (like 3d 
 * transformation and coordinate system, mesh, texture...). Knowledges about OpenGL or Direct3D could help, but are not
 * absolutely needed.
 * 
 * Hardware specification:
 *
 * An OpenGL 3.x graphics card :
 *  - ATI: from R600 ( from Radeon HD 2400 ). R700 (Radeon HD 4850)
 *  - NVIDIA: OpenGL 3.0, OpenGL 3.1 and OpenGL 3.2 require G80, or newer hardware, i.e. GeForce 8000 series or higher; Geforce G100, GT120, 130, 220, GTS 150, GTS 250, GeForce GTX 260 and higher, any ION based products. Quadro FX. Available on mobile version too.
 *
 *
 * API Support from:
 *  - AMD:
 *    - The OpenGL ES2.0 is supported on all cards that are supported now (from HD2xxx and up).
 *    - The OpenGL 4.1 is supported since HD5xxx and up.
 * 
 *  - NVIDIA:
 *    - Supports OpenCL 1.0 (Open Computing Language) for all GeForce 8-series and later GPUs.
 *    - Supports OpenGL 3.3 for GeForce 8-series and later GPUs.
 *    - Supports OpenGL 4.1 on GeForce 400 series and later GPUs.
